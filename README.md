# Automatic-Detection-of-the-Occupation-of-an-Interior-Space

Automatic building occupancy detection can be used successfully in the implementation of energy-saving strategies.
As, for reasons of privacy, it is not feasible, in most of the case, the installation of surveillance cameras, it is necessary
that the presence of occupants in an interior space is made through a more indirect monitoring. For this purpose,
sensors were placed in space to measure humidity, temperature, light and carbon dioxide. For a period of time, the
data recorded by those sensors were collected at various times of the day, together with an indication of the presence
or not of occupants.
It is intended, with the present work, the development of a machine learning (ML) model, supported by the Random
Forest algorithm, which will allow in the future to automatically detect the occupation of the space concerned based
on the information given by these sensors.
